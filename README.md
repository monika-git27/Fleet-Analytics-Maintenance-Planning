# Fleet-Analytics-Maintenance-Planning
## Overview

This project analyzes SkyFleet’s aircraft fleet using SQL and Tableau to support maintenance planning, spare part forecasting, and operational efficiency improvements. The analysis focuses on fleet composition, age, fuel efficiency, engine type, and retirement planning to provide actionable insights for airline management.

## Objective

* Analyze fleet composition and operational status.

* Identify aircraft models with higher maintenance and operational risks.

* Forecast spare part demand based on aircraft age, engine type, and efficiency.

* Support maintenance planning and inventory allocation to reduce operational costs.

 ## Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Performed SQL queries to analyze:

* Fleet Status: Active vs Retired aircraft

* Fleet Age Distribution: Average, youngest, and oldest aircraft per model

* Seating Capacity: Average, minimum, maximum per aircraft model

* Fuel Efficiency: Fuel burn per seat

* Engine Type Breakdown: Count, average age, and fuel consumption

* Range Efficiency: Km per litre burned

2. Business Analysis

* Age-based Aircraft Classification: New (0–9 yrs), Mid-life (10–20 yrs), Old (>20 yrs)

* Spare Part Demand Forecast: High/Medium/Low demand proxy based on fleet age and fuel efficiency

* Fleet Standardization Index: Unique models vs total aircraft to assess maintenance complexity

* Aircraft Retirement Forecast: Immediate, near-term, and healthy active aircraft

* Engine Type & Spare Part Planning: Focused on dominant engine types for inventory planning

* Fuel Inefficiency Analysis: Identify models requiring frequent maintenance

## Tools & Technologies

* SQL: Data querying and aggregation

* Tableau: Dashboard creation and data visualization

* Excel / CSV: Dataset exploration

## Business Value

* Optimized spare part inventory based on fleet age and efficiency.

* Supported cost reduction through fleet standardization insights.

* Enabled data-driven fleet renewal and maintenance planning.

* Identified high-risk aircraft models for proactive maintenance.
